Raghad J. Data Science Portfolio 
## 📂 Targeted Industry Focus
I am interested in applying my spatial expertise to:
**Agriculture (AgTech):** Using multispectral imagery and regression models (XGBoost/Random Forest) to monitor crop health and predict yields.
**Logistics & Tech (e.g., Fuso/Rakuten):** Optimizing supply chains and "last-mile" delivery through spatial clustering, network analysis.
**Healthcare & Sustainability:** Analyzing spatial access to medical services and modeling environmental change for habitat conservation.
**Imagery & Remote Sensing:** Leveraging `Rasterio` and `Deep Learning` to extract features from satellite and aerial data.

## 🦆 About Me
When I'm not writing Python scripts or querying databases, I am an avid bird watcher. I find that the patience and observation skills required for birding translate perfectly to the meticulous work of data cleaning and pattern recognition.
